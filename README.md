# Day-04-Linux-Processes-and-Services
 **Day 04 – Linux Practice** in **only 3 lines total**:  Use `ps aux` or `top` to check running processes and resource usage. Use `systemctl status service_name` to inspect a systemd service and logs. For issues: check process → service → logs using `ps`, `systemctl`, `journalctl`.
